A difficult question, but extremely relevant at a stage where technology is starting to provide us with some quite robust solutions to technical problems that have constrained robot development over the years. This paper discusses the role that anthropomorphism plays in robotics research and proposes that research on human -robot interaction or social robotics is the primary motivation for incorporating human aspects in robotics.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews “socially interactive robots”: robots for which social human–robot interaction is important. We begin by discussing the context for socially interactive robots, emphasizing the relationship to other research fields and the different forms of “social robots”. We then present a taxonomy of design methods and system components used to build socially interactive robots. Finally, we describe the impact of these robots on humans and discuss open issues. An expanded version of this paper, which contains a survey and taxonomy of current applications, is available as a technical report [T. Fong, I. Nourbakhsh, K.

  Abstract                 = {Following Langer (1992), this article reviews a series of experimental studies that demonstrate that individuals mindlessly apply social rules and expectations to computers. The first set of studies illustrates how individuals overuse human social categories, applying gender stereotypes to computers and ethnically identifying with computer agents. The second set demonstrates thatpeople exhibit overlearned social behaviors such as politeness and reciprocity toward computers. In the third set of studies, premature cognitive commitments are demonstrated: A specialist television set is perceived as providing better content than a generalist television set. A final series of studies demonstrates the depth of social responses with respect to computer ‘personality.’ Alternative explanations for these findings, such asanthropomorphism and intentional social responses, cannot explain the results. We conclude with an agenda for future research.},

Remote presence and tele-operation systems are expanding our understandings of how people interact through robots, incorporating these systems into their own sense of agency. As such, robotics can inform our understanding of both robotic agency and human agency.},
