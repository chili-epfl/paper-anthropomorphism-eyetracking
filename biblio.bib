We illustrate the social phenomenon of anthropomorphism which describes people’s tendency to attribute lifelike qualities to objects and other non lifelike artifacts. We present theoretical backgrounds from social sciences, and integrate related work from robotics research, including results from experiments with social robots. We present different approaches for anthropomorphic and humanlike form in a robot’s design related to its physical shape, its behavior, and its interaction with humans. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of anthropomorphism in robotics, collects and reports relevant references, and gives an outlook on anthropomorphic human-robot interaction.},

The first set of studies illustrates how individuals overuse human social categories, applying gender stereotypes to computers and ethnically identifying with computer agents. The second set demonstrates thatpeople exhibit overlearned social behaviors such as politeness and reciprocity toward computers. In the third set of studies, premature cognitive commitments are demonstrated: A specialist television set is perceived as providing better content than a generalist television set. A final series of studies demonstrates the depth of social responses with respect to computer ‘personality.’ Alternative explanations for these findings, such asanthropomorphism and intentional social responses, cannot explain the results. We conclude with an agenda for future research.},

Each level is exemplified by existing systems. In conclusion, when referring to anthropomorphism -- for instance in relation to an interface or system -- we must be clear about which level we indicate, since each has its own characteristics and involves specific types of user expectations.},

Generally, the concept anthropomorphism is used to describe this process. Anthropomorphism is defined in different ways, with much focus on either typical human attributes or uniquely human attributes. This difference has caused different measurement tools to be developed. We argue that anthropomorphism can best be described as a continuum ranging from low to high human likeness, and should be measured accordingly. We found that anthropomorphic characteristics can be invariantly ordered according to the ease with which these can be ascribed to robots.},

  Abstract                 = {Personal robots present opportunities for understanding the ways that people perceive agency-both in-the-moment and reflectively. Autonomous and interactive personal robots allow us to explore how people come to perceive agency of non-human agents. Remote presence and tele-operation systems are expanding our understandings of how people interact through robots, incorporating these systems into their own sense of agency. As such, robotics can inform our understanding of both robotic agency and human agency.},
